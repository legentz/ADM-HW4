1. Scraping the website through BautifulSoup (generator)
2. Scraper on a server
3. Merge results and build the two TSV datasets 
4. K-Mean clustering through sklearn linked module (No ++)
5. Elbow method to study the best no. of clusters 
6. Get top-3 for each of them 
7. Compare the overall results 
8. Compare the top-3 of each dataset
9. [...]

1. Proceed with the definition of a hash function
2. HashTable has to be defined as a python class (dictionary style)
3. *Iterate in parallel (multiprocessing as we do not need any memory sharing)
4. Found 10M duplicates
5. Check collisions probabilities 

* shared memory hashtable required!
